    <h3>Meditation as viewed in the buddhism</h3>
    <p>
      meditation can be viewed and defined in many different ways,<br />
      for the buddhists- <em>meditation is following our higher purpose.</em
      ><br />
      Essentialy that is a way of getting in touch with reality,<br />
      embrace whatever is presented infront of you,<br />
      and by doing so resistance is vanished(external and internal),<br />
      you start to flow with the natural stream of life - <br />
      and in some sense serving a bigger purpose,
      <strong>one that you are not necesseraly aware of.</strong>
